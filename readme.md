The [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) is a fun emulation project that serves as an introduction to the world of the emulators.

There are many game roms scattered around the internet to be played on your version of the virtual machine.

Currently this project already has the [35 opcodes implemented](https://github.com/joaorodriguesjr/chip8/blob/development/src/Chip8/Mapper.js) but is lacking a good input system on the interface. Maybe i'll do virtual keyboard for it to be controlled on a smartphone too.
